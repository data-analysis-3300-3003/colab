This data is stored in cloud optimised GeoTIFF (COG) files; see the below notes on how to read data from COG files for a region of interest (`Window`). \n",

    "\n",
    "We can read data from COG files in the cloud using rasterio in a similar way to how we've been reading local GeoTIFF files on our machine. \n",

    "\n",
    "However, our GeoJSON geometry will be in EPSG:4326 (geographic) coordinate system which could be different from the CRS of the COG we're trying to read data from. This requires us to use rasterio `transform_bounds()` function to transform our bounding box coordinates to the coordinates of the COG data. \n",
    "\n",
    "To summarise this process: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. use `features.bounds()` to convert GeoJSON or Shapely `geometry` to a bounding box.\n",
    "2. use `warp.transform_bounds()` to convert the bounding box to the CRS of the COG data.\n",
    "3. use `windows.from_bounds()` to convert the reprojected bounding box to a `Window` object.\n",
    "4. pass the `Window` object to `read()` to read only data from the COG within the `Window`. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Working with collections\n",
    "\n",
    "We are reading Landsat data from images that form a STAC Item Collection - the <a href=\"https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/dataset/landsat-c2-l2\" target=\"_blank\">Landsat Collection 2 Level 2</a> collection. The images in the collection can come from different sensors, have different coordinate reference systems, and overlap. Thus, to ensure that the data we read from different images to match our `Window` has the same shape, we can pass a shape into the `out_shape` argument of rasterio's `read()` method. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we get the shape of the first NumPy `ndarray` that we read from a COG file. Then, for all other `read()` operations we pass this shape into the `out_shape` argument. You can see this implemented below in the `if` and `else` blocks.  "

    "We can inspect the metadata of the COG file we are reading data from. We can see that its width and height are far greater than width and height of the windowed read of data that corresponded to our bounding box (width = 59, and height = 46). This is because the metadata corresponds to the entire Landsat scene, but we extracted a small subset of this data that intersects with our bounding box. This is why we computed the `win_transform` object above as this affine transform object allows us to reproject the `ndarray` generated by the windowed read (i.e. relate elements in the NumPy `ndarray` to positions on the Earth's surface).
