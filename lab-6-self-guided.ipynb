    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "## SpatioTemporal Asset Catalogs (STAC)\n",
    "\n",
    "This lab will demonstrate how to search for and download geospatial data in the cloud. \n",
    "\n",
    "It will introduce <a href=\"https://stacspec.org/en/\" target=\"_blank\">SpatioTemporal Asset Catalogs (STAC)</a>, a specification that makes it easy to query and search through large collections of geospatial data assets stored in the cloud. \n",
    "\n",
    "You will also learn to use the <a href=\"https://pystac-client.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">pystac_client</a> package which provides tools for working with STAC in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let's briefly outline what the STAC specification is before completing some data querying and downloading tasks to make the concepts concrete.\n",
    "\n",
    "**spatiotemporal asset:** this is a file comprising geospatial data for a location and point in time. For example, this could be Landsat or Sentinel-2 satellite images stored in the cloud such as in Microsoft Azure or Amazon Web Services. This is a file that we can download and use the data in our analysis and applications. However, if you look at <a href=\"https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/catalog\" target=\"_blank\">Microsoft's Planetary Computer Data Catalog</a>, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/search/results?trk=868d8747-614e-4d4d-9fb6-fd5ac02947a8&sc_channel=el&FULFILLMENT_OPTION_TYPE=DATA_EXCHANGE&CONTRACT_TYPE=OPEN_DATA_LICENSES&filters=FULFILLMENT_OPTION_TYPE%2CCONTRACT_TYPE\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon Web Services Open Data</a>, or the <a href=\"https://explorer.sandbox.dea.ga.gov.au/stac/\" target=\"_blank\">Digital Earth Australia Open Data Cube</a> you will see there are lots of spatiotemporal assets available (for free). The challenge is searching through these collections of assets to find the data you need and downloading it. The STAC specification provides a solution for this. \n",
    "\n",
    "The STAC specification comprises:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **STAC Item** - a GeoJSON feature that represents a spatiotemporal asset with links to the spatiotemporal asset and additional metadata fields (e.g. bounding box, thumbnail, datetime, cloud cover).\n",
    "* **STAC Catalog** - a JSON file of links to STAC Items to support querying and retrieving STAC Items. STAC Catalogs can comprise sub-catalogs that group together related data within a larger structure. For example, Microsoft's Planetary Computer might create a STAC Catalog for all of its spatiotemporal assets and organise these assets in sub-catalogs (e.g. a catalog for Landsat 7, Landsat 8, Sentinel-2, SRTM DEM etc.).\n",
    "* **STAC Collection** - an extension of a STAC Catalog with additional metadata properties (e.g. extents, licences, providers) to describe STAC Items within the collection. \n",
    "* **STAC API** - an API that allows clients to query a STAC collection, search for STAC Items, and retrieve their links for downloading. The search endpoint is designed to recieve queries of STAC Catalogs that filter on location, date, and time as well as other fields. It returns a GeoJSON FeatureCollection object with of STAC Items that meet the search criteria. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Task\n",
    "\n",
    "We're going to use the pystac_client package to query a range of STAC Catalogs hosted in the cloud. We'll complete the following tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Find the least cloudy Sentinel-2 image for a field in Western Australia using the Microsoft Planetary Computer.\n",
    "* Find the least cloudy Sentinel-2 image for a field in Western Australia using Amazon Web Services.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tips\n",
    "\n",
    "These are some tips for working with STAC here.\n",
    "\n",
    "* use rectangular bounding boxes or area-of-interest geometries to quickly identify STAC Items that intersect with their extent.\n",
    "* for exploratory work use small areas-of-interest to minimise the size of searches of STAC Collections and the amount of data transmitted over the network. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Useful links\n",
    "\n",
    "* <a href=\"https://stacspec.org/en\" target=\"_blank\">STAC website</a>: the STAC homepage with details about STAC, tutorials, and links to STAC catalogs.\n",
    "* <a href=\"https://radiantearth.github.io/stac-browser/#/\" target=\"_blank\">STAC Browser</a>: a web browser to search for STAC catalogs.\n",
