    "\n",
    "Raster data breaks the Earth's surface up into a grid of cells (pixels). Each pixel is assigned a value that corresponds to the geographic feature or phenomenon of interest. For example, pixels in a raster precipitation dataset would be assigned a numeric value that represents the amount of precipitation that fell at that location. Pixels in a land cover map would have an integer value that corresponds to a particular land cover class label. The values assigned to pixels in a raster dataset are the attribute information. \n",

Each pixel represents a 300 m x 300 m area on the Earth’s land surface and a pixel can only represent a single land cover type. If you look at the bottom two zoomed in maps you can see some limitations of representing land cover using 300 m x 300 m spatial resolution raster data. The shape of land cover features are poorly represented by the “block-like” arrangement of pixels and there is variation in land cover within a single pixel (a mixed pixel problem).\n",

    "Colour is represented by combinations (addition) of red, green, and blue light. Red, green, and blue are primary colours and combine to form white. An absence of red, green, and blue is black. Secondary colours can be formed by the addition of primary colours of varying intensities (e.g. yellow is the addition of red and green, magenta is the addition of red and blue, and cyan is the addition of green and blue). \n",
    "\n",
    "Computer displays consist of red, green, and blue sub-pixels, which when activated with different intensities, are perceived as different colours. The range of colours that can be displayed on a computer display is called the gamut. Colour in computer programs is represented as a three byte hexadecimal number with byte 1 corresponding to red, byte 2 corresponding to green, and byte 3 corresponding to blue. Each byte can take the range of 0 to 255 in decimal. 0 indicates the absence of a colour and 255 indicates saturation of that colour:\n",

    "Computer displays represent colour through varying the intensity of sub-pixel displays of red, green, and blue light. Variability in data values in multiband rasters can be visualised by relating data values in one band to the intensity of one of the primary colours on the computer display. Visualising a multiband raster in this way creates an additive RGB or colour composite image - it is called a composite image because each pixel is a composite of red, green, and blue light.\n",
    "\n",
    "Above we rendered the red, green, and blue band reflectance from the Sentinel-2 image separately. However, if we combine these reflectance measures into a composite image (e.g. where red reflectance is represented by sub-pixel intensity of red light) we can create a true colour image as if we were looking down on the Earth's surface with our eyes.\n",

Band 4 corresponds to red reflectance in Sentinel-2 images, band 3 corresponds to green reflectance, and band 2 corresponds to blue reflectance. We can pass `rgb` into the `imshow()` function to generate an RGB image of the field.\n",
