    "## Client-server architectures\n",
    "\n",
    "The client-server architecture is a model for describing computer-to-computer communication. Much of the internet, and web-enabled applications, utilise the client-server model for data exchange. For example, a client application such as your web browser can request data from a server (e.g. the data required to render the web page on your display). If the client's request is valid, the server will respond by sending the requested data to the client. This model of clients sending a request and servers responding with data is at the heart of the client-server protocol.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a schematic from MDN Web Docs that illustrates how a client, here a web browser, requests data from various servers to build a web page on the client's display. When the servers have processed the client's requests, the arrows depicting data flow on the diagram below will reverse and the servers will respond by sending the requested data to the client.\n",

    "\n",
    "Perhaps the most common example of client-server computing is web browsers requesting data from servers to render web pages. However, many applications can act as clients. For example, two servers in the cloud could communicate in a client-server manner with an application on one server requesting data from another. Or, various sensors (e.g. weather stations) could act as clients and post data to a server as new measurements are taken. They key point is that client-server computing describes a way that two applications can communicate over a network and share data. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you open up Google Chrome and then go **View** &rarr; **Developer** &rarr; **Developer Tools** and head to https://www.openstreetmap.org/ you can see your browser making requests to OpenStreetMap and rendering the responses (PNG files among other data) on a web map (you can also try this for other websites and see if you can spot data sent by the server to your browswer which is then rendered on the display). \n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure you have the **Network** tab selected and are viewing **All** messages. You can click on a message to see its structure and the data transferred. \n",

    "### Task\n",
    "\n",
    "The tasks for this lab are i) to generate requests and process responses that scrape data from DPIRD's Agriculture and Food website, and ii) to develop a small weather data application for a field in Western Australia based on a client-server model. The client will make requests for weather data to a server which will respond with weather data matching parameters set out in the request. The client will the visualise this weather data. "

    "## HTTP \n",
    "\n",
    "Hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP) is the protocol that describes how messages are exchanged between clients and servers. \n",
    "\n",
    "To send messages via HTTP a connection between the client and the server needs to be created. HTTP messages are sent over a <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/TCP\" target=\"_blank\">transmission control protocol (TCP)</a> connection. TCP connections are used to send HTTP messages as they ensure that all data sent is delivered in the right order (i.e. data transfer between clients and servers is error free).\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the connection is created, the client sends a HTTP message to the server over the connection. The server responds with a HTTP message sent back to the client. Then, the connection is closed or reused for subsequent requests. \n",
    "\n",
    "HTTP messages have a well-defined structure. **Request** messages start by specifying the HTTP method, then the path to the server or resource they are making a request to, followed by the HTTP version of the message. The path can be a complete <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/URL\" target=\"_blank\">URL</a>; for example, to request the data to render the coursebook in your browser you need to send a request to `https://data-analysis-3300-3003.github.io/coursebook`. \n",
    "\n",
    "After the line denoting the HTTP method, path, and version, <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers\" target=\"_blank\">HTTP headers</a> are specified. This is extra information that is provided to the server to help handle the request (e.g. you could put credentials for authentication here or descriptions of data included in the body). HTTP headers comprise a name and a value separated by a colon `:`. The following headers are used to describe data in the body of a request message:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `Content-Length: <size of data in body of HTTP message - decimal number of bytes>`\n",
    "* `Content-Type: <type of data in body of HTTP message>`\n",
    "* `Content-Encoding: <compression algorithm used to compress data in body>`\n",
    "\n",
    "These are examples of headers used to pass credentials to the server for authenticated access to server resources (e.g. if you are sending a username and password to the server). \n",
    "\n",
    "* `Authorization: <authentication scheme> <credentials>`\n",
    "\n",
    "The HTTP Basic authentication scheme sends username and password combinations as base64 encoded data **(note, this is not encrypted and just text data encoded in a different format. So, this is not secure unless sent over an encrypted connection - you can see if your connection is encrypted as the url will start with https (and not http)).** If our username is `testuser` and our password is `testpassword` we'd include our credentials in a HTTP message header as:\n",
    "\n",
    "`Authorization: Basic dGVzdHVzZXI6dGVzdHBhc3N3b3Jk`\n",
    "\n",
    "`dGVzdHVzZXI6dGVzdHBhc3N3b3Jk` is the base64 encoding of `testuser:testpassword`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, data can be included in the request body. If you are POSTing data to a server, such as an image in PNG format or text as JSON data, this is where that data would go. \n",

    "\n",
    "Once the server has received and processed a client's request, it sends a **response** message. Similar to the request message format, the HTTP response includes the version of the HTTP protocol, a status code indicating if the request was successful or failed, HTTP headers which provide information for the client to process the response, and a body containing data the client requested. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to be aware of HTTP response status codes to identify if your request to a server was successful or if there was an error that you'll need to address. A HTTP response status code greater than or equal to 400 indicates an error occurred and the request could not be processed. You can read up on the range of status codes <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>. \n",

    "\n",
    "### HTTP methods\n",
    "\n",
    "HTTP request messages start with a <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods\" target=\"_blank\">HTTP method</a>. These indicate how the server should handle the client's request. Some of the commonly used HTTP methods are listed below:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `GET`: request a specified resource or data.\n",
    "* `POST`: post data to the server. \n",
    "* `DELETE`: delete the specified resource or data on the server. \n",
    "* `PUT`: replace the specified resource or data on the server. \n",
    "\n",
    "Generally, we don't need to write HTTP messages manually but software applications do this for us. Commonly, this is done by your web browswer or apps on your smartphone. When we're working in Python we can use the <a href=\"https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/quickstart/\" target=\"_blank\">requests</a> package to make and handle HTTP requests and responses. \n",
    "\n",
    "The requests package has a `requests` object with methods for each of the HTTP methods. You can see the docs for the `requests` object <a href=\"https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/#requests.request\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>. The general pattern for using a `requests` object method is:\n",
    "\n",
    "`r = requests.<http method>(<url>)` \n",
    "\n",
    "where `r` is a response object from the server. For example, we can make a request to get image data that is rendered on DPIRD's Agriculture and Food website under their <a href=\"https://www.agric.wa.gov.au/dry-seasons-and-drought/seasonal-climate-information\" target=\"_blank\">seasonal climate information</a> tool. We pass in the url to where the image is located on a server to the `get` method. The server returns to us a response object referenced by `r`. Let's start by downloading some of the images of potential yield maps.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get the url for an image, you can navigate to their website, right click on the image, and copy image address. \n",

We'll then sum the daily precipitation values over the growing season and convert the response to a pandas `DataFrame`. \n",
