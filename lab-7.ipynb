    "# Introduction\n",

    "## Web mapping\n",
    "\n",
    "Static maps are rendered images with detail and styling to highlight a specific location, feature, or phenomenon. However, they are limited. A static map of a wide-area will omit local detail, and a static map of a small area will omit wide-area context. They are not interactive.\n",
    "\n",
    "To addresss these limitations, and using web technologies such as making HTTP requests, web maps are interactive maps that update the information shown in response to user input (zooming in and out, panning).\n",
    "\n",
    "To generate a web map your web browser, or another client application such as an app on a mobile device, makes a HTTP request to a server to GET a web map. The client's HTTP request will include some parameters that describe the map it wishes to receive such as the location and zoom level. In response, the server will either generate the map dynamically (i.e. query a spatial database and render an image) or retrieve a pre-generated map image and respond by sending the map image to the client. Often, this image is in JPEG or PNG format. The client will then render the map in the client application that made the call to the web map server. \n",
    "\n",
    "As you interact with the web map on your display (e.g. with your mouse zooming in and panning), the client will send new requests to the server which will respond by sending updated image data. This is what makes web mapping interactice. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Web maps\n",
    "\n",
    "<a href=\"https://www.e-education.psu.edu/geog585/node/685\" target=\"_blank\">Quin (2020)</a> describe a web map as comprising three components or layers:\n",
    "\n",
    "* basemap: underlying spatial layers designed to provide geographic context. These are often pre-rendered map tiles that fuse together several spatial layers (e.g. roads, water bodies, buildings) that are not the main focus of the map. \n",
    "* thematic elements: geographic features that are the main focus of the map and are rendered on top of the basemap layers. Often, these elements are styled to emphasise patterns in the data or distinguish these elements from the basemap. These could be layers that you can toggle on and off. \n",
    "* interactive elements: there can be interactive elements rendered on a web map that provide extra information in response to user input (e.g. hover or popup text windows).\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also think of there being three types of web maps:\n",
    "\n",
    "* dynamic: dynamic web map images are rendered on demand following a client request by a map server. Depending on how the server is configured, it can generate bespoke web maps for a particular client from spatial data.\n",
    "* tiled: tiled web map images are pre-generated and stored in cloud storage or in a database and a server retrieves the appropriate image tiles to fill the client's web map, as indicated by parameters in the client request, and sends them to the client.\n",
    "* client-generated: coordinates representing a geometry (e.g. a GeoJSON object) are sent to the client and a client application, such as a web browser, renders the geometry on a web map.\n",
    "\n",
    "In reality, we often mix these three different types of web maps to produce a final composite web map. For example, dynamic map servers can generate tiles creating the \"illusion\" of a tiled map output. Or, we might use a pre-generated tiled basemap to provide geographic context and then use a dynamic web map to render \"real-time\" information in a spatial layer on top of it. An example of this is visualising traffic information with traffic-light shades on top of Google Maps pre-generated basemap tiles. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Task\n",
    "\n",
    "The focus of this lab is to provide an introduction to web mapping technologies, highlight their strengths and limitations for particular contexts, and provide some recipes for how you can request web map data using Python. First, we will demonstrate how to request web map layers from servers that implement the Web Map Services (WMS) specification (dynamic web maps); a range of data providers make their data accessible as WMS services (e.g. Digital Earth Australia and public datasets in Western Australia via the Data WA Data Catalogue). Second, we will explore the structure of pre-generated tiled web maps based on XYZ map tiles or \"slippy\" maps which are often used for generating basemap images (e.g. in OpenStreetMap or Google Maps). Finally, we will demonstrate how you can dynamically generate basemaps from high-resolution remote sensing data stored in cloud-optimised GeoTIFF (COG) files. \n",

    "You can run the labs locally on your machine or you can use cloud environments provided by Google Colab. **If you're working with Google Colab be aware that your sessions are temporary and you'll need to take care to save, backup, and download your work.**\n",

    "## Web Map Services (WMS)\n",
    "\n",
    "Servers implmenting the Web Map Services (WMS) specification support dynamically drawn web maps. It is an Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) specification that server-side applications implement to describe the requests they can receive to generate web map images on-demand for clients. \n",
    "\n",
    "The client request to a WMS server indicates the location, extent, coordinate reference system, and potentially a range of other parameters that determine how the web map is generated and styled from spatial data (e.g. a spatial database). The server responds by sending a rendered image of the spatial data as a JPEG or PNG file. \n",
    "\n",
    "As you move around and zoom in and out of your web map widget (e.g. in your browser), new requests are sent to the WMS server and it responds by generating new images and sending them back to the client to construct the web map in the user interface. \n",

    "\n",
    "<details>\n",
    "    <summary><b>Can you think of a disadvantage of dynamically generating web map images from spatial data in response to client requests?</b></summary>\n",
    "If you move around quickly in your web map widget, you might generate lots of requests for the WMS server to handle (query a spatial database for relevant data, render spatial data into an image, and send the image back to the client). The server might not be able to keep up with the speed at which you are moving around in the web map widget and you will experience a lag. A lag could also be generated if a WMS server is handling requests from many different clients. \n",

    "\n",
    "A client makes a request to a server implementing the WMS specification by sending a HTTP message to URL of the server. The client includes information for server to use when handling the request as query parameters appended to the URL. The WMS specification has a `REQUEST` parameter; when this is set to the value `GetMap` it will request the server to generate a web map image. Setting the `REQUEST` value to `GetCapabilities` will return a metadata about the WMS server. Values set for the `REQUEST` parameter indicate the WMS operation the server should undertake - you can see the list of operations <a href=\"https://docs.geoserver.org/latest/en/user/services/wms/reference.html#operations\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.\n",

However, there are some data transformation steps you'll need to go through including rescaling the pixel values to between 0 and 255, setting the `dtype` to `byte`, and reprojecting the data to Web Mercator (`EPSG:3857`). This can be a long-running operation so we won't demonstrate it here. \n",

    "\n",
    "However, COG files do present a nice trade-off between pre-generated XYZ tiles and dynamically generated WMS layers. COG files are GeoTIFF files, like the local GeoTIFF files we have been using to store raster data, but they support reading data via HTTP GET requests with with range requests specifyied by a `Range` header. This allows us to i) store large COG files either locally or in cloud storage, ii) only read subsets of the data in the COG file into our program via HTTP requests, and iii) avoid the need to set up, manage, and interact with a map server that provides WMS services for dynamic web map image generation. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the *lab-6-self-guided.ipynb* notebook we made windowed reads of raster data, using rasterio, that corresponded to an area of interest from COG files in Microsoft's cloud storage (the COG files were stored in Microsoft Azure blob storage and accessed via Microsoft's Planetary Computer). This is an example of making a HTTP range request to a COG file. However, we can also read data from COG files in the cloud, dynamically convert this data to XYZ tiles, and render it on web maps. \n",

    "Let's look at the metadata for the `\"visual\"` asset. This is pre-formatted true colour image data stored as a cloud-optimised GeoTIFF file and generated from the Sentinel-2 satellite data. We can confirm this by printing the data values in the dictionary object indexed by the `\"visual\"` key.  We can see it has three bands which correspond to red, green, and blue reflectance (see the `band_metadata` and `colorinterp` keys). We can also see an `overviews` key, this indicates `overviews` have been computed and are stored in the COG file - these are zoomed out low-resolution images.
